# Basic Frontend Projects

This repository is dedicated to **practicing and understanding core frontend development concepts** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
Each project in this repository is designed to strengthen fundamental skills, including **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, **game logic**, and **basic animations**.

##  Purpose of This Repository
The main purpose of this repository is to:
- **Learn and practice** how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to build interactive web pages.
- Gain hands-on experience with **DOM events**, **dynamic content rendering**, and **basic UI/UX design**.
- Create **small, fun projects** that can evolve into larger applications.

##  Concepts Practiced
### **HTML**
- Structuring content using semantic tags.
- Creating reusable and meaningful elements.

### **CSS**
- Styling web pages using **selectors**, **box model**, and **flex/grid layouts**.
- Applying **transitions, animations**, and **responsive design**.

### **JavaScript**
- **DOM Manipulation:** Using `querySelector`, `getElementById`, and `innerText` to change elements dynamically.
- **Events & Listeners:** `addEventListener` for clicks, keypresses, etc.
- **Game Logic:** Implementing conditions, loops, and arrays to detect game states (e.g., win or draw).
- **Functions & Variables:** Writing reusable code to reset, enable, or disable elements.

##  Key Learnings from Projects
1. **Tic Tac Toe**
   - How to detect winning patterns using arrays.
   - Switching turns between players using boolean variables.
   - Handling draw cases when all cells are filled.
   - DOM updates with `innerText` and `classList`.

2. **Flappy Bird**
   - Controlling game elements using key events.
   - Collision detection and score tracking.
   - Using `setInterval` or `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth animations.

## üõ† Tools & Technologies
- **HTML5** for layout.
- **CSS3** for styling and animations.
- ** JavaScript*** for logic and interactivity.
- 
##  Future Learning Goals
- Build more **interactive web projects** like calculators, weather apps, and memory games.
- Understand **APIs and Fetch** for dynamic data.
- Explore **React.js** and **modern frontend frameworks** after mastering core JavaScript.

##  Contribution
